## Description

Our mission is to help people explore and get to know the area they reside, or are visiting. We achieve this by giving them activities within a ZIP code the user choses
Motivation for development?
You know when you're asked “what kind of stuff is there to do around here?” and you draw a complete blank! Or its time to go out with friends/family/date and your doing the same thing you always do and life just feels so boring! Most of the time there is so much to do. we just don't know what is new or even out there. Now with Getaway we know, and can do all the fun stuff our area offers!
