## Description

### Mission
<p>Our mission is to help people explore and get to know the area they reside, or are visiting. We achieve this by giving them activities within a ZIP code the user choses</p>

### Motivation for development?
<p>You know when you're asked “what kind of stuff is there to do around here?” and you draw a complete blank! Or its time to go out with friends/family/date and your doing the same thing you always do and life just feels so boring! Most of the time there is so much to do. we just don't know what is new or even out there. Now with Getaway we know, and can do all the fun stuff our area offers!</p>

### 3rd Party APIs Used

[MapBox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/) - Mapbox API functionality was to get user longitude and latitude based on their zipcode that we fetch through their API server.</p>
        
[Triposo](https://www.triposo.com/api/documentation/20200803/) - After getting the longitude and latitude from Mapbox then fetch it through Triposo API and from there navigated their data to get Name/Description/Url</p>
